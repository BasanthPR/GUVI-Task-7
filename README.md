Glass identification 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification - Dataset

Have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python Pandas, including dropping irrelevant fields for predicted values, and
standardization of each attribute.
Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models should be created for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan
distance. The performance of the two models using different distance metrics is compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and
Scikit-Learn Classification Report.
